GEMM: C <- beta C + alpha AB
    with C in K^mxn
         A in K^mxk
         B in K^kxn
         alpha, beta scaling factors

Question 1: School method
    A_i  :=  ith row
    B_j  :=  jth col

    for i = 1..m
        for j = 1..n
            C_ij <- beta C_ij
            C_ij <- C_ij + alpha dot(A_i, B_j)

    with dot() being the dot product of two vectors


Question 2: Col-major
    A_l  :=  lth col
    C_j  :=  jth col

    for j = 1..n
        for l = 1..k
            if l = 1
                beta_tild = beta
            else
                beta_tild = 1

            C_j <- beta_tild C_j + alpha B_lj A_l   (daxpy)


Question 3: Row-major
    B_l  :=  lth row
    C_i  :=  ith row

    for i = 1..m
        for l = 1..k
            if l = 1
                beta_tild = beta
            else
                beta_tild = 1

            C_i <- beta_tild C_i + alpha A_il B_l   (daxpy)
