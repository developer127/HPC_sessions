Quesion 1:
    Walltime gives back the number of hardware dependent ticks since
    a process is started.
    CPU Time only counts the ticks while the process is actually processed
    on the CPU.

Question 2:
    The process of initializing the matrix can use the cash,
    when the storage format is the same as writing the values
    for initialization.
    Hence the benchmark is better for col major storage because
    initializing also goes col major.
    We could change initMatrix by switching inner and outer loop
    to getter a better result for row major stored matrixes.

Question 3:
    When the size of a Matrix is small and the initialization very fast
    the granularity of time is too big to measure the actual time used.
    To get reliable results we do the short process several times until
    a minimum time MIN_T is reached. To get the precise average time
    we afterwards devide by the number of times the process was executed.
