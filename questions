Questions to session 11:

Why do we use an interface?
wouldn't it be better to implement (copy paste) a direct version
to our new matrix class or changing the ones in bench.h ??
E.g. the assertions we have in our Matrix class are not invoced!

What if I want to use a function created by a lamda expression more than once?
-> I can define the function as
    auto function = lambda exp.
and use later function();

question 1 page 3:
The funcion object is created, when instantiated and ceases to exist, when it's
work is done. Meaning when the funcion gave back the return value.
It is a temporary object living on the stack.

question 2 page 3:
std::random_device()() needs to paares of parantheses because:
with the first we call the constructor,
with the second we make a call to itself to actually produce a uniformly
distributed random number as a seed for mt19937.




Question page 01:
1. the offset of two subsequent array accesses is incRowA * sizeof(double)
    = 1*8 = 8 bytes
2. n * 8 bytes because incRowA = n

3. becaues n > 1000 only one number is taken from each cashline loaded
    in the second case max 64/sizeof(double) = 8
    can be fetched from one cashline.
