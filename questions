Question page 01:
1. the offset of two subsequent array accesses is incRowA * sizeof(double)
    = 1*8 = 8 bytes
2. n * 8 bytes because incRowA = n

3. becaues n > 1000 only one number is taken from each cashline loaded
    in the second case max 64/sizeof(double) = 8
    can be fetched from one cashline.
